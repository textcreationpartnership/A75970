         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>WE Miniſters of Chriſt, whoſe names are under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written, having ſought Gods direction, and enquired of his holy Word concerning our duty, and finding our ſelves under many obligations to ſeek di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently the edification and ſalvation of ſouls; and withal conſidering the greatneſs of our Work, and the ſhortneſs of our own and our neighbours lives, and the ſtrict account that we and they muſt ſhortly yield to God our Judge; Do humbly bewail our too great ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect, that we have not more frequently, earneſtly and unweariedly employed our care and time, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour on ſo great a Work, according to the ſtrict and holy precepts and patterns in Gods Word; eſpecially that we have done no more in Catechiſing, and familiar perſonal inſtructing, to acquaint men with the moſt neceſſary points of our Religion, and to work them on their hearts, for the awakening of them from ſecurity, and drawing them from ſin to God, by the faith of Chriſt, and for the directing them in the right way to their everlaſting peace. And as we earneſtly beg of God to pardon this our great neglect, through the blood and interceſſion of Ieſus Chriſt; ſo do we by his grace reſolve to be hereafter more faithfull and diligent, and

            </p>
            <p n="1">I. That we will in the ſeveral united Churches of this County, &amp; the adjacent parts, where we are Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, ſet apart <gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

            <p n="2">II. That we will hereafter, by Gods aſsiſtance, lay out more of our time, and labour, in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid work of Catechizing, and familiar inſtructing people in the Doctrine of Salvation: And, that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily we will ſet apart a convenient ſtated time for this work, at leaſt on one day every week, and in greater Pariſhes, either two or three; or elſe more hours on that one day, as our ſtrength, and other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary imployments ſhall permit. And whereas we have only hitherto Catechized the younger people in publike; we ſhall now deſire either the whole Families to come together by their turns, to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain place, on a certain ſtated day, &amp; hour, or ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them that are not Catechized publikely. And the Clerk or ſome other fit perſon ſhall be ſent to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:170223:4"/> them ſome days before, to remember them of their turns, and to know whether they will come, or not.</p>
            <p n="3">III. We conceive the fittteſt place for the aged, will be the Miniſters houſe, unleſs where ſome ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial accident may make another place more Fit. Or if any rather chooſe to do it in the Church, or that their children and ſervants be chatechized in publique, and themſelves in private, We ſhall grant their deſire: and though it be the duty of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to come to the Miniſters for inſtruction, in any convenient place which they ſhall appoint, which all humble and obedient Chr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſtians wil readily yield to, yet if any will not come to us we ſhal go to them, if they conſent to hear us, and to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed: The like we ſhall do to thoſe who by reaſon of Age or other weakneſs, or diſtance, cannot well come to us, or at leaſt we ſhall procure ſome that are ſit for ſuch a work, to go to them, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct them, if by weakneſs or greater works we are hindred our ſelves.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. If any be unwilling to be chatechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, or inſtructed before the reſt of the family, we ſhall do it as privately as they pleaſe: only we ſhall catechize the women, eſpecially the younger ſort in the preſence of ſome of the reſt, leſt malicious wicked perſons ſhould make it an occaſion of ſcandal and reproach: but we ſhall
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:170223:5"/> as carefully as we can avoid the opening of the weakneſſes of parents, or maſters, in the hearing of their children, or ſervants, in any way that may tend to the diminiſhing of their authority and due reſpect.</p>
            <p n="5">V. We ſhall deſire all our pariſhioners, old and young, that are able, to learn the ancient Creed, with out Expoſitory profeſsion, or Catechiſm con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining it, the ten Commandments and the Lords prayer, and the Aſſemblies ſhorter Catechiſm; and thoſe that cannot (at leaſt without longer time) learn the Catechiſm, we deſire them firſt to learn all the reſt; and thoſe that cannot ſo ſoon learn our profeſſion, we ſhal expect at leaſt that they learn the Creed, the Commandments, and the Lords prayer, and endeavour to learn the reſt in further time, as they are able; or if any pretend ſcruples againſt our <hi>Profeſsion,</hi> or the <hi>allowed Catechiſm,</hi> they ſhall uſe any Orthodox Catechiſm which themſelves will chooſe.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. When we receive an account from them of what they have learned of theſe heads of Chate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm, we ſhall alſo faithfully endeavour to help them in the right underſtanding of them, and to get the truths which they learn into their hearts and lives; in all which we ſhall endeavour as prudently as we can, to ſuit our Inſtructions and Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:170223:5"/> ſeeking to diſgrace them, or puzzle them by hard unneceſſary queſtions or words, but expreſs the plaineſt neceſſary truths in the plaineſt words; and if they underſtand not one phraſe, we ſhall try whether they underſtand the ſame truth in other phraſes: nor ſhall we ſtand ſo much on their words as their meanings; and if they be not able to deliver a fundamental truth in any tolerable words of their own, we ſhall try by their affirmations or negations whether indeed they underſtand it or believe it, when they hear it expreſt by us: we ſhall endeavour alſo to uſe ſuch love and meekneſs as may win, and avoid ſuch harſh imperious ſpeeches as may offend, and to uſe ſuch ſeriouſneſs as may tend to awaken the ſtupid and ſecure, leſt all our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour with them be loſt, and yet ſuch tenderneſs as that the weak may not be diſcouraged. And, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is a work that requireth ſuch great prudence and holy skill, together with zeal, and patience, we ſhall the more reverently and cautelouſly attempt and mannage it, avoiding all raſhneſs, obſerving and lamenting, and ſtriving againſt our impruden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, unskilfulneſs, and other unfitneſſes; and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly beg of God more fitneſs for his work.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. Thoſe that have not learned the words of any of the aforeſaid Principles, or Catechiſms, we ſhall yet deſire to come to us with the reſt of their families, that we may have opportunity familiarly to diſcourſe with them, and inſtruct them.</p>
            <pb n="8" facs="tcp:170223:6"/>
            <p n="8">VIII. We ſhall deſire that the moſt learned, or judicious and Godly people among us would ſubmit to this courſe, as well as others, though they have not the like need, leſt their forbearance be a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to others to keep off; eſpecially ſeeing the wiſeſt and Godlieſt men are bound by God to obey their teachers, and guides, as well as others; and all Chriſtians have need to keep the great fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental truths ſtill in memory, for their daily uſe, that they may live upon them; and the beſt may yet get ſome advantage by ſuch conferences, which Miniſters will fit to their riper ſtate.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. Having procured this our Agreement to be printed, together with an exhortation to our people to ſubmit to this work, we ſhall firſt read both to them in the publique aſſembly upon ſome Lords day, and afterward give and cauſe to be delivered one Copy thereof to each family in our ſeveral pariſhes that will accept them, deſiring them that they may be read to all the family.</p>
            <p n="10">X. As for thoſe that after ſufficient admonition ſhal contemptuouſly and obſtinately refuſe to be either <hi>Catechiſed</hi> or <hi>Inſtructed,</hi> thus perſonally, by us, giving us no valuable reaſon of their refuſal, if they are ſuch that have profeſſed themſelves members of our Charge, in the particular Churches whereof we are Paſtors, we ſhall proceed as in other caſes of ſcandal, or impenitency, til we have either prevailed for their
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:170223:6"/> reformation, or elſe rejected and avoided them. And if they are ſuch that are only members of the Pariſh, and have withdrawn themſelves from our charges and the particular Church, by refuſing to own and profeſs their memberſhip, we ſhall yet ſo far difference them from the reſt of the pariſh, who are Tractable and Teachable (though refuſing to be of our particular Church, and charge) as that we ſhall, in regard of Communion, and the application of ſealing and confirming ordinances, deal with them as the obſtinate deſpiſers of inſtruction ſhould be dealt with.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <p>THE reaſons which move us to this Agreement and Reſolution, are theſe following.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As it is undeniable that the everlaſting perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of multitudes is cauſed by their Ignorance, and people periſh for lack of knowledge; ſo is it moſt evident that catechizing and familiar perſonal inſtruction, is a great means to overcome that killing ignorance; and that much of the darkneſs of this Land is chargeable on the neglect of this neceſſary work.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The aged among us are too commonly more Ignorant then the younger ſort; and though their ſouls ſhould be as much regarded by them, yet have
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:170223:7"/> we no hope of prevailing with theſe to come publikly on the Lords day, in the face of the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, to be catechiſed; but yet we are in hope that fewer of them will refuſe to come to us in private; and ſeeing we are thus neceſsitated to deal in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate with one part of the family, if it be their deſire, we ſhall take all together in the ſame way; Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps one will encourage another. We obſerve alſo that the younger when they are once married, will come no more to be catechized publikely, and ſo too many forget that which before they had learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which this courſe may prevent.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is the principles and fundamental truths that life or death doth moſt depend upon, &amp; in which the eſſentials of Chriſtianity do conſiſt; which therefore no man may be utterly ignorant of, that hopeth for ſalvation; and which the ripeſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans have the greateſt daily uſe for, and moſt conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually live upon as their bread and drink: and thoſe that are well grounded in theſe fundamentals, are likeſt to ſtand in a time of trial, and to reſiſt tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and to hold faſt, and grow up in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the ſuperſtructure; and it is the want of being well grounded in theſe fundamentals, that is the cauſe of much of the hereſie and apoſtacy of this Age. It is the improvement of theſe principles that is the true Chriſtians daily work, for the mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of his duties, the quickening and ordering of his affections, and the guidance of his life; and it is
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:170223:7"/> the want of ſound digeſting and improving of theſe that is the cauſe of much of the hypocriſie, and ſelf-deceiving opinionative and factious kind of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, that hath ſo prevailed: In a word, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of right Catechizing, and the miſchiefs that follow the neglect of it, are more indeed then we can expreſs or conceive.</p>
               <p n="4">4. We finde by ſad experience, that the people underſtand not our publike teaching, though we ſtudy to ſpeak as plain as we can, and that after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years preaching, even of theſe ſame Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, too many can ſcarce tell any thing that we have ſaid, when yet we finde that they better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand and lay to heart a familiar Conference.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Lords day is ſhort enough for the publike worſhip of God, and preaching of the word, with thoſe private duties which are neceſſary in our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, though we reſerve Catechizing, at leaſt of the aged, to another day, eſpecially in the Winter, when the days are ſhort.</p>
               <p n="6">6. By this means we ſhall better know the ſtate of our hearers, and better know how to ſpeak publikely to their neceſsities, and how to pray for them; and how far either to be moan them, or rejoyce over them, and we ſhall better underſtand their capacity and fitneſs for Communion and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments.</p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:170223:8"/>
               <p n="7">7. If we appoint not a ſtated time and place for this work, we cannot tell how to have any fit oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity for it: becauſe we know not when to finde people at leiſure together, and prepared thereto: nor can every weak Miniſter endure the attendance and inconvenience of ſome of their houſes, for ſo long time, without apparent injury to their health or lives.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The diligence of Papiſts and Sectaries will condemn us, if we will not do half ſo much in a right way, to ſave mens ſouls, as they will do in a wrong way, to pervert them. The Papiſts will bring all the people to confeſs their moſt ſecret ſins in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret to their Prieſts; and we have heard of ſome that have approved of their Church rather then ours, becauſe it is more ſtrict in ſuch practiſes. The Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of other Sects creep into houſes, and lead cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive the ſilly people by their ſmooth deceiving words and induſtry: If we then that have a better work to do, ſhall betray mens ſouls by lazie negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences, all theſe might riſe up againſt us and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn us.</p>
               <p n="9">9. The work that we agree upon is of unqueſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able neceſsity; it is not of the controverted mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, where ſome godly men are of one minde, and ſome of another: we know of no party reputed ſober and pious among us, but are all agreed of the uſefulneſs and excellency, which is more then the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:170223:8"/> lawfulneſs of this Catechizing, and familiar inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; and we obſerve them all as with one minde and mouth, complaining of the neglect of it, and commending the performance; we think it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a ſad and unexcuſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ble thing, that while we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend about controverſies, moſt ſhould neglect that neceſſary work, which all approve of, even while they thus neglect it.</p>
               <p n="10">10. It is a work wherein we have the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of authority. Former Rulers commanded Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techizing, and the preſent do not diſcountenance it, but encourage us to ſuch works. It hath been the conſtan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ce of the Primitive Church, who had oft their Catechiſts to teach theſe principles; and all Ages have allowed it without any conſiderable contradiction; And the Catechiſm which we agree to uſe was approved by the Church Aſſemblies of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> as a part of the Unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.</p>
               <p n="11">11. We receive the publike maintenance to this end, that we may be enabled to lay out our endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour for the good of the whole Pariſhes from which we do receive it; and therefore we are further ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged in Juſtice to do our beſt for the ſalvation of them all.</p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:170223:9"/>
               <p>Upon theſe plain and preſsing Reaſons (among others) we finde our ſelves called to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment our former negligence, and more diligently to perform this needfull work, and to exhort our Pariſhioners to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage us by their ſubmiſsion, and willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and we do reſolve upon a more faithful diſcharge of this duty to thoſe that ſhall thus ſubmit.</p>

               <p>DEarly beloved Brethren, whoſe ſouls are precious both to Chriſt and us, and whoſe Peace and Salvation we do earneſtly deſire. It hath pleaſed the God of all the Earth to call out this poor unworthy Iſl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, while others live in horrid darkneſs; Here hath he Proclaimed the Goſpel of his dear Son, and made plain to us the way to everlaſting felicity: He hath not dealt ſo with every N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>tion, nor have they heard and ſeen what we have done. Moſt of the world do lie in the darkneſs of Heatheniſh Idolatry, Infidelity and Mahometaniſm: and too much of Chriſtendom in the darkneſs of Popery and Hereſie. It ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h pleaſed the Lord of the Harveſt, to ſend forth La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:170223:11"/> into this part of his Harveſt; though, we confeſs, too weak and imperfect, yet more nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and faithful, and diligent, then moſt of his Churches elſewhere Proportionably can ſhew. He hath wonderfully diſpelled the miſts of Popery, and many of his ſervants have laid down their lives in the flames in witneſs againſt it; and with a mighty hand hath he hitherto hindred its return. We have the holy Scriptures faithfully tranſlated into our own Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and Bibles ſo common, that every family may have one or more at a ſmall price, and may make them the matter of their daily exerciſe. We have this Scripture weekly at leaſt read and preached to us publikely. we have the living examples of many that fear God, in whoſe hearts his Law is written, though imperfectly, and in whoſe lives it is expreſt. We have very great Numbers of excellent Books, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding this Scripture, and plainly directing us in the way to Salvation; ſo that we know no Nation that in their own tongue hath the like. And among the reſt we have the ſumm of Chriſtian Religion in Catechiſms, in ſo ſmall a room, that the weak may learn, underſtand, and remember it.</p>
               <p>Yet after theſe wonderful mercies and means, we muſt needs confeſs it, to the grief of our ſouls, that many thouſands in this Land of light, do wilfully live in darkneſs: And whereas they might all, for the time and means, have been able to teach others, they have need to be taught again the very principles of Gods Oracles, and to be fed as babes
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:170223:11"/> with milk, and not with ſtrong meat, as being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilful in the word of Righteouſneſs, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.12, 13, 14. It aſtoniſheth us many times when we have occaſion to talk with ſome of our hearers, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that they know very little of the Doctrine which we have been preaching to them ſo many years, as plainly as we could ſpeak: If we could ſpeak plainer to them we would; for we know it is a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that they muſt underſtand or periſh. It is ſad to us to hear many men, that can talk underſtandingly about matters of the world, that can ſcarce ſpeak a word of ſenſe about the matters of their Salvation, or ſcarce give us any reaſonable anſwer, if we Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Upon this ſad experience of mens Ignorance, we have been brought to a deep Conſideration of our own Neglects; and the Lord hath partly ſet it home upon our hearts, and in the apprehenſion thereof our ſouls have been brought low, to think how we have wronged Chriſt and you, and leſt God ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire your blood at our hands. For though we have frequently and faithfully taught you in publike, which is enough to leave you without excuſe, yet perceiving that it muſt be a more familiar courſe that muſt help the extreamly ignorant to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, we lament that we have done no more in it then we have done. And though ſome of u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:170223:12"/> Profeſſion, and the ten Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the Lords Prayer, and this ſmall Catechiſm, and the ſhorter Catechiſm of the Aſſembly of Divines. And if you cannot read, get ſome to read them to you that can. We intreat you alſo to take ſome pains to ſee that your families do all learn the ſame: and eſpecially beſtow all that time on the Lords day in this exerciſe, which can be ſpared from the greater parts of Gods ſervice: As alſo that you would bring all your family with you (except the children who are catechized in the Congregation) at the time, and to the place that ſhall be appointed, there to render ſome account of what you learn, and to entertain ſome familiar conference about it, that you may be further In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in the way to life. If you know never ſo much already, we ſuppoſe you will not loſe your labour: and the moſt Judicious ſhould be the moſt humble, Obedient and exemplary to the weak. If you have learned never ſo little, and find it hard to remember the words, yet we intreat you to come with the reſt, for ſome familiar Conference and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction: For the leſs you know and remember, the more help you need.</p>
               <p>Now the Lord hath awakened us his unworthy Meſſengers to the ſenſe of our duty, O do not you diſcourage us, and pleaſe the Devil, and fruſtrate all our work and hopes, by your wilful refuſal; eſpecially when we call you to no Controverted work, but that which all the ſober Chriſtians in the

You can have no ſuch excuſe to cover your refuſal: but if you will not Learn and Obey, you muſt even ſpeak out, and ſay you will not, and tell God plainly ſo to his face, and ſo let your naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs appear to all. Now God hath put it into our hearts to do you good, and cauſed us to thirſt after the welfare of your ſouls, we beſeech you take heed of Refuſing your mercies. If you come to us to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the way to ſalvation, we dare not for all the world refuſe to teach you: for then how ſhould we meet the Lord in Judgement, and look him in the face that made us watchmen for mens ſafeties! How then Dare you refuſe to be Taught, or to beſtow your time and Labour for to Learn?</p>
               <p>Dear Brethren, the Lord who is our Judge and yours, knows, that it is not a deſire to domineer over your Conſciences; nor any pleaſure that we take in needleſs troubling you; much leſs any ill will to you, that cauſed us to take up this Reſolution, and to call you to this work: But it is the ſenſe of our former ſin and preſent duty, and of the great Neceſſity hereof to your Salvation. Alas, fleſh and blood hath kept us from this duty too long already: and if we would hearken to it, we ſhould not ſo much trou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:170223:13"/> Indeed, we cannot but expect that this work which we have now undertaken, ſhould bring upon us much more labour or trouble to the fleſh, then all our Publike preaching doth. We are frail ſinners, and have fleſh and blood as well as you, that would fain draw us back from ſuch troubleſome duties, and perſwade us to take our eaſe, and not to loſe the love of our Neighbours by moleſting them: But woe to us and you if this ſhould prevail you ſhould therefore rather encourage us, and warn us to be Diligent, and to take heed to our Miniſtery which we have received in and of the Lord, and to fulfill it, <hi>Col.</hi> 4.17. If we were Stewards for the ſupply of your bodily wants, you would call to us for help, and not ſtay till we ſeek to you; much leſs would you refuſe it. We have all need to joyn heart and hand, to help one another ſafe to Heaven; and all little enough, when we have ſuch enemies within us, and without us; and ſo many difficulties before us to overcome. We know that you will have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Temptations from Satan, to keep you back from this profitable work; He that is unwilling of your Salvation, will be unwilling that you ſhould learn the way to it. He will perſwade the Rich and worldly-wiſe, that it is a buſineſs unbeſeeming them to be Catechized or Inſtructed; As if they were too good to obey Chriſt and hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

We know that we and you are haſting to the Judgement ſeat of Chriſt, where we muſt be accountable for our Teaching, and you of your learning, and both of our Obeying and Love to the Truth, and of all the time and means that we did poſſeſs. We know that it is but a little while till we and you muſt be all gone hence, and the places where we live muſt know us no more. We know that then we ſhall wiſh we had been more diligent in Teaching, and you will wiſh you had been more diligent in Learning; and all of us in Obeying! O Sirs, what ſhould you ſo much think on, as the God whom you ſay you love and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and the heaven that you ſay you hope for ever to enjoy, and the Neceſſary way that leads thereto? If you are Chriſtians, what ſhould you more mind then Chriſt and his Benefits? <hi>Col.</hi> 4.1, 2, 3, 4, 5. <hi>Math.</hi> 16.19, 20, 21, 23. John 6.27. Will you drop out of the world, before you have well Conſidered what you had to do in it? will you loſe the laſt hour or part of your Lives as you have done the reſt? yea and make that a reaſon for it? As if you would not Learn in your Age, becauſe you learned no ſooner? will you live all your youth with purpoſes to repent and turn to God in your Age? and then when Age comes, will you refuſe to Return becauſe you did it not ſooner? What is this but to abuſe Chriſt all your youth, and then abuſe him more in your Age, becauſe you abuſed him in your youth!
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:170223:15"/> How will you think of this fooliſh wickedneſs when you look back upon it in Hell, if your found Repentance and Returning to God by Chriſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it not?

We beſeech you therefore rather lay by any thing then theſe needful works: you have nothing elſe to mind, that in Compariſon of this is worth the minding: it is for this that all things elſe muſt be Uſed. In themſelves they are but as childrens toys; will you play with them till they and you do fall together in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the duſt? and that while greater things ſtand by? It is Chriſt, and Grace, and the promiſed Glory, that will never deceive you, if you will but ſeek him, and ſet your heart upon him, and eſteem him above theſe tranſitory things, and make it the chief buſineſs of your life to Pleaſe and Enjoy him; which cannot be without the knowledge of him. Is it not pitty that God ſhould have any Reaſonable Creature that Knoweth not his Maker or his Laws, or his own hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs? it not pitty after all that Chriſt hath done and ſuffered for the world, that any that call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves his Diſciples, ſhould ſo little know him, and the ſalvation which he hath purchaſed, and ſhould ſet ſo light by him, as to reject his invitations? and

And the Spirit to <hi>write Chriſts Law within you! Heb.</hi> 10.16. Then would you long for more of Chriſt, and run after him in his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances with thirſting ſouls, and delight in his Law, and meditate in it day and night, and love his Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and delight to do his will, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.22. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.2, 3. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.8. <hi>&amp;</hi> 119.24.77.35. <hi>&amp;</hi> 40.1.2. Theſe things would not only be your buſineſs, but your Pleaſure; even your meat &amp; drink, <hi>Job</hi> 23.12. <hi>O that you did know in this your day the things that belong unto your Peace, before they are hid from your eyes!</hi> Luke 19.41, 42. And that you would once ſoberly Conſider what it is to be in Everlaſting Joy or Torments! and that you would live as men that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve theſe things indeed!</p>
               <p>We do yet again beſeech you in the name of him that Made you, and Redeemed you, and for the ſake of your own immortal ſouls, that you will not be ſo ſtout, or ſelf-conceited, or ſo careleſs, or ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuous
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:170223:16"/> of the Grace of the God, as to refuſe to come to your Teachers to be Catechiſed and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, or to beſtow your labour in learning theſe Principles. You can loſe but little by it, and only that which however you ſhall ſhortly loſe. You may get that which ſhall never be loſt. O what a Glory would it be to our Pariſhes, and to the Land, if you would all joyn as with one mind to learn and ſtudy the things of Chriſt! what a Joy would this be to the hearts of your Teachers, to ſee you readily with one accord to come to them for Inſtruction, and obey the word. All the wealth of the world would not ſo glad them, or do them ſo much good as this would do!

The word of God will certainly be made good: And, he hath expreſly ſaid, that <hi>if the Gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are loſt: in whom the God of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, leſt the light of the glorious Goſpel of Chriſt, who is the Image of God, ſhould ſhine unto them.</hi> 2 Cor. 4.3, 4. <hi>And people periſh where viſion faileth, and for lack of Knowledge,</hi> Prov. 1.22.29. &amp; 29.18.

               <p>It grieveth us alſo to ſee ſo many untaught chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and families among you! to ſee the Lords day ſo idly ſpent when you have ſo much of this ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary work to do! To ſee ſo many of you either live without the Lords Supper, and the holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Church, or elſe expect it when you know not what you do. And it much grieveth us when we come to viſit the ſick, and would fain ſpeak Comfort to their departing ſouls, and find them in ſo Ignorant and Carnal a ſtate that we dare not do it. O what a trouble muſt this needs be to our minds! You look that we ſhould ſpeak Peace to you at the hour of Death, that will nor learn the way of Peace in your life, but rather abhor it and wilfully reject it. But that is a thing that we may not do; and if we ſhould do it, we ſhould but deceive you.</p>
               <p>Brethren, take time and mercy, while the God of

It is the higheſt, the nobleſt and ſweeteſt work that you can mind, or be imployed in! Other things are drudgery to this, and muſt give place to it. Harden not therefore your hearts againſt the Inſtruction and help that is offered you. It is none of our purpoſe to queſtion you in matters of Scholarſhip, but of meer Chriſtianity; nor to ſhame the Ignorant, but to teach them; nor to puzzle you with hard unneceſſary Queſtions, but to ſpeak to you according to your ſeveral Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.

               <p>Finally Brethren, we conclude with the repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our former requeſt, that if God have ſo much intereſt in you, if Chriſt and the holy Ghoſt have ſo much Intereſt in you, if your own Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be any of your Intereſt, or if we your Teachers and friends have any Intereſt in you, we earneſtly beſeech you, that not one family, nor one perſon, old or young, would deny us this requeſt, which we make, to our own Labour, but for your Good: Firſt that you would take ſome pains, to Learn over the Creed with out Expoſitory Profeſſion, the Ten Commandments, and the Lords Prayer, our ſmall Catechiſm, and the Aſſemblies ſhorter Catechiſm. Secondly that you would ſee that all your Children and Servants (that are capable) learn them:
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:170223:18"/> eſpecially on the Lords day. Thirdly, that you would not refuſe to come when you are called, to give your Teachers an account of your Knowledge, and (how little ſoever you have learned, yet) to receive Inſtruction by them. And think it not too much that we deſire you to come to us; for as you know it is a more regular and certain way for all to come to one place, then for us to go ſeek after every perſon, not knowing where and when to find them; ſo is it no more then you owe to your Teachers (in order to your own good;) when God hath made them <hi>Stewards of his houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, to give them their meat in due ſeaſon,</hi> Luke 12.42. Tit. 1.7. 1 Cor. 4.1, 2. and hath Commanded you <hi>to obey them that have the Rule over you, for they watch for your ſouls, as thoſe that muſt give account, that they may do it with Joy and not with Grief, for that is unprofitable for you.</hi> And Mal. 2.7. <hi>For the Prieſts lips ſhould keep Knowledge, and they ſhould ſeek the Law at his mouth: for he is the Meſſenger of the Lord of Hoſts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the Lord bow your hearts ſincerely to yield to this our advice, it will be the Joy of your Families, the honour of your Towns, Pariſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But if after all that we can ſay or do, you unthankfully and obſtinately refuſe the
